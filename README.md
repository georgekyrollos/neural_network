# Neural Network Notebook

This project is a **from-scratch feed‑forward neural network** implemented and demonstrated in a Jupyter notebook. It shows how to:
- Build a network with one or more hidden layers
- Initialize weights and biases
- Run forward passes to get predictions
- Compute a loss over a training batch
- Backpropagate gradients
- Update parameters with gradient descent
- Track training progress (loss/accuracy)
- (Optional) compress or speed up parts of the network with simple tricks
- Visualize or print results

> This README avoids math and focuses on what to do and where to do it.

## What the Notebook Contains

- **Configuration cells**: Set seed, learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, layer sizes, and activation choice.
- **Utility code**: Helpers for batching data, shuffling, timing, plotting, and basic checks.
- **Model code**: Plain‑Python/Numpy implementation of layers, activations, forward pass, backprop, and parameter updates.
- **Training loop**: Loads data (or generates synthetic data), iterates over epochs/batches, prints/plots metrics.
- **Evaluation**: Shows predictions, accuracy, and/or sample outputs on a validation/test set.
- **(Optional) Extras**: Simple low‑rank tricks for weight matrices and other speed/size tweaks.
- **Notes/Markdown**: Short explanations of the concepts behind each step (kept readable without formulas).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (3.10 or 3.11 recommended)
- **pip** (or conda)
- Packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (if you want plots)
  - `jupyter` or `jupyterlab` to run the notebook

Install quickly with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## How to Run

1. **Open the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Neural_Network.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   jupyter lab Neural_Network.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run cells top‑to‑bottom**: From the menu, choose **Run ▸ Run All Cells** (or use Shift+Enter cell by cell).

3. **Pick your data**:
   - If the notebook includes a data loader, point it to your CSV/NumPy file path in the “Data” section.
   - If there’s a synthetic dataset cell, run it to generate toy data and verify the model works end‑to‑end.

4. **Train**:
   - Adjust the **hyperparameters** cell (learning rate, epochs, hidden layer sizes).
   - Run the **training loop** cell. You should see loss/accuracy printouts or a plot.

5. **Evaluate**:
   - Run the evaluation cell(s) to see accuracy, example predictions, and any charts.

6. **Save/Export (optional)**:
   - If the notebook includes save logic, it will write weights to a file (e.g., `.npz`). Record the path it prints.
   - You can export the notebook to a Python script via **File ▸ Save and Export As ▸ Executable Script** in Jupyter.

## How to Use With Your Own Data

- **Input features**: Put your features into a 2D array (rows = samples, columns = features).
- **Targets/labels**: Put your targets into a 1D array (for regression) or encoded class indices/one‑hot rows (for classification), depending on the notebook’s expected format.
- **Split**: If the notebook doesn’t already, split into train/validation/test sets (e.g., 70/15/15).

**Where to change it**: Look for a cell titled “Data” or “Load Dataset.” Replace the sample data block with your own file path and parsing code (e.g., using `numpy.loadtxt` or `pandas.read_csv`).

---

## Common Tweaks

- **Hidden layer sizes**: Increase for more capacity (e.g., `[64, 64]`), decrease for speed.
- **Learning rate**: If loss doesn’t go down, try a smaller rate; if it’s too slow, try a bit larger.
- **Epochs**: More epochs usually improve fit until you overfit.
- **Batch size**: Larger batches train faster per epoch but may generalize differently.
- **Activation**: If supported, try ReLU, tanh, or another activation in the config cell.
- **Regularization** (if present): Turn on weight decay/dropout for overfitting control.

---

## Interpreting Output

- **Loss**: Should generally decrease over time during training.
- **Accuracy (classification)**: Should increase as training progresses.
- **Predictions**: Inspect several example predictions to confirm the model is learning the right patterns.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing happens when I run a cell**: Make sure the kernel is started (look for a “busy” indicator in Jupyter).
- **ImportError**: Re‑install required packages with `pip install numpy matplotlib`.
- **Loss is `nan`**: Start with a smaller learning rate; check for invalid label formats.
- **Shapes don’t match**: Print shapes of inputs/weights in the failing cell; the first layer’s input size must equal your feature count.

```

## FAQ

**Can I run it as a script?**  
Yes. From Jupyter, use “Export as Executable Script,” then run `python Neural_Network.py`. You may need to move configuration values to the top of the script.

**Where do I change the network shape?**  
Look for a list/tuple of layer sizes in the configuration cell (e.g., `[input_dim, 32, 32, output_dim]`).

**Can I save the trained model?**  
If a “save” cell exists, run it after training. It will write weights to a file you can later load for inference.

If you want, I can auto‑extract the exact knobs (hyperparameters, file paths, function names) from your notebook and tailor this README to match line‑by‑line.
